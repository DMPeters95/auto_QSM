# Introduction

This package sets up a DICOM image reconstruction server. It is able to:

1. Listen to and handle incoming DICOM transfer
2. Process the incoming DICOM image with customized reconsturction script
3. Push the processed DICOM image back to the request peer. 
4. Back up all the DICOM transfer history to a external storage device on a daily basis. 




# Requirement

1. System: 
This package has been tested on:
	Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64bit
	Ubuntu 15.10 64bit
	Mac OS X 10.6.8
	Mac OS X 10.10

2. Software:
	daemonize	(http://software.clapper.org/daemonize/index.html)
	dcmtk 3.6.0	(http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en)

3. Reconstruction script:
This package uses program "medin" for DICOM --> QSM reconstruction
However, it can be replaced by any command-line reconstruction script whose input/output format is DICOM image, with changes in auto_QSM/src/recon_script accordingly. 




# Installation

1. Unzip the package:
$ tar -xvzf auto_QSM.tar.gz
or get it from Github
$ git clone https://github.com/leonhart217/auto_QSM.git

2. cd to the root folder:
$ cd auto_QSM

3. Prepare binary files with auto_QSM/dep/bin_dep_[Your System Version].tar.gz:
$ mkdir -p bin
$ tar -C bin -xvzf dep/bin_dep_[Your System Version].tar.gz
	
[Note]: if your OS is differnet from those in Requirement, you may compile/install the required dependency binary file from source code:
	average_binary:
		Source code: auto_QSM/dep/src_dep.tar.gz/average_binary.c
	storescp_mod:
		Source code: auto_QSM/dep/src_dep.tar.gz/storescp_mod.cc
		Compiled with dcmtk 3.6.0
	gdcmdump:
		Install GDCM 2.4: http://gdcm.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

4. (Optional) Add auto_QSM/bin to $PATH in order to debug the package from command line
For example for Ubuntu:
$ echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/bin" >> ~/.profile
$ . ~/.profile
or for Mac OS X:
$ echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(pwd)/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
$ . ~/.bash_profile

5. run
$ ./install





# Configuration

1. System setting: auto_QSM/src/setup_config
	disk_data_fix:
		This is recommended to be manually set for the Filesystem of server's system drive ${disk_data}

2. User setting: auto_QSM/etc/config_user
	flag_auto_backup:
		Automatically backup data from DICOM archive in system drive to external drive
		Backup will happen when available space on ${disk_data} is below 80GB, and only happen at 3am ~ 5am, at most once per day.
		Note: if this option is on, it is recommended to manually set the following in in auto_QSM/src/setup_config
			mount_backup_fix: for the mount point of external drive

3. Scanning list: auto_QSM/etc/scanner_list
Each new scanner information should be added as a row with:
	[manufactor brand]	[AETitle] [IP address] [port] [relay server name, if needed]

4. If any configuration changes are made, restart the server by (Make sure the server is not currently running anything important):
$ auto_QSM/src/restart_all





# Frequent Q&A
Q1. Do I need to compile the dcmtk and daemonize before installing this package?
A1. Compilation and installation of dcmtk and daemonize are recommended. However, one can choose to use pre-compiled binaries for dcmtk which is available online:
	dcmtk 3.6.0	(http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en)
For pre-compiled binary for daemonize, please contact the author.
Note: when using pre-compiled binaries, please make sure the path to the binaries is added to $PATH in crontab

Q2. How do I check if the package is properly functioning?
A2. Simple check: in Ubuntu or Mac OS, run:
$ ps -u ${USER} -f | grep auto_QSM
Typical output has one running instance for each of "qsmrecon_main", "dicom_listen" and "check_log_size". It also has one or more instances for "storescp_mod". If flag_auto_backup is on, it should also has one instance of "auto_backup"
Full check: more detailed information can be found in the log files:
	buffer/log_stdout_qsmrecon_main:	
		log of the recon script (E.g. check if one series is completely received; archive received DICOM; examine the DICOM header information)
	buffer/log_stdout_dicom_listen:
		log of DICOM transfer (E.g. check if a port has been used; check if a peer is able to be accessed)
	buffer/log_QSM:
		log of successfully reconstructed case(s)

Q3. How do I un-install this package?
A3.	1. Backup the data in your DICOM archive ($HOME/data by default)
	2. Run (under auto_QSM)
	$ cat crontab.bak | crontab -
	$ src/kill_all
	3. Remove the auto_QSM folder
